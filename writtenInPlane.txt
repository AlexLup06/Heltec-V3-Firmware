- two versiona of Aloha: one sends right away when it has a message to send. The other one only sends if there is no ongoing transmission currently. Once it does not hear any onging transmission it sends the message

- csma: regular csma without rts/cts. the slottime is 200ms. we have no headers and possibly send 255 with the first packet. other nodes have to wait for that packet before sending
=> figure out whats wrong; do we really have less collisions. We dont have a centralizede coordinator. this only works in fully meshed network and not a dyamic topology. Maybe shorter slottime as a result? Right now this is just random channel access. More like random slotted access 

- rs_imitra: we have request to send and clear to send. here we also have random access like above because i did not understand how it worked. do we even need the backoff period? Probably yes. the shorter it is the higher the chance for collision. We send a rts. we have csma for CTS because the nodes get the RTS practically at the same time. 


Open Questions:
-- is CSMA synchronized??
